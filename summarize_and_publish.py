    "- Start by explaining the real-world problem the research addresses.\n"
    "- Then describe what the researchers did to tackle it.\n"
    "- Clearly state what they found and why it matters.\n"
    "- Avoid technical terms and explain complex ideas in everyday language.\n"
    "- Use 5 to 8 natural, flowing sentences. Imagine you're talking to an interested teenager.\n"
    "- Use third person only (never 'we' or 'I').\n"
    "- Round numbers and give context when useful.\n"
    "- Make it sound human, helpful, and easy to read.\n\n"

    "Original abstract: 'Deep-learning models for prostate cancer detection typically require large datasets, limiting clinical applicability across institutions. This study aimed to develop a few-shot learning model that uses minimal data. It was tested on real-world scans and compared to radiologists.'\n\n"
    "Summary: 'Prostate cancer is often diagnosed using MRI scans, but training AI tools to read them usually takes lots of data. This study developed a model that learns from just a few examples. It was tested on real cases and performed almost as well as experienced doctors. This approach could help smaller hospitals use AI even if they donâ€™t have huge datasets.'\n\n"
